# Fake-News-Classification
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning models. The dataset contains text- based features like titles, authors, and article content, which are pre-processed and transformed into numerical representations for modelling. Various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests are implemented and evaluated to identify the most effective model for predicting fake news. The final model is then utilized to make predictions on unseen test data.
